<h3>pk</h3>
<p>
    PK is a thought-provoking film that combines humor, philosophy, and social commentary. Directed by Rajkumar Hirani and starring Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma, it takes the “stranded alien” theme, familiar from classics like E.T., and tells the tale equally from the lonely alien’s eyes

<h3>Avenger</h3>
<p>
“Avengers: Endgame” is the culmination of a decade of blockbuster filmmaking, the result of years of work from thousands of people. It is designed to be the most blockbuster of all the blockbusters, a movie with a dozen subplots colliding, and familiar faces from over 20 other movies. It’s really like nothing that Hollywood has produced before, existing not just to acknowledge or exploit the fans of this series, but to reward their love, patience, and undying adoration. The blunt thing you probably want to know most: It’s hard to see serious MCU fans walking away from this disappointed. It checks all the boxes, even ticking off a few ones that fans won’t expect to be on the list. It’s a satisfying end to a chapter of blockbuster history that will be hard to top for pure spectacle. In terms of sheer entertainment value, it’s on the higher end of the MCU, a film that elevates its most iconic heroes to the legendary status they deserve and provides a few legitimate thrills along the way.
